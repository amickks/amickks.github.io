I spent a couple of months in November and December 2020 practicing jewelry-making techniques with brass and copper. The result is a series of kinetic rings, made to roll and spin between the fingers, some of which are pictured here. I made two abacus inspired rings from brass with guitar string beads and small locknuts and several roller rings using found beads and metal bushings.
