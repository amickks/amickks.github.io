In the summer of 2022 I worked in the Organic Robotics Rab at Cornell University as a part of the NSF-funded CROPPS project. I worked on fabrication and testing of a earthworm-inspired, soil-swimming robot. Developed gait patterns for surface and belowground locomotion using 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuators. implemented sensors and steering.
