Earthworm-inspired, soil-swimming robot as a part of NSF-funded CROPPS project for agricultural soil sensing. Tested and developed gait patterns for 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuators. Implemented sensors and steering to take measurements of soil and rhizosphere properties.

<!--In the summer of 2022, I worked in the Organic Robotics Lab at Cornell University as a part of the NSF-funded CROPPS project. I worked on fabrication and testing of a earthworm-inspired, soil-swimming robot. I used arduino and mini solenoid valves to develop gait patterns for surface and belowground locomotion using 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuators. I went on to work on the implementation of sensors and steering to allow the device to take measurements of soil and rhizosphere properties. -->
