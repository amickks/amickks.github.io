In the summer of 2022, I worked in the Organic Robotics Rab at Cornell University as a part of the NSF-funded CROPPS project. I worked on fabrication and testing of a earthworm-inspired, soil-swimming robot. I used arduino and mini solenoid valves to develop gait patterns for surface and belowground locomotion using 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuators. I went on to work on the implementation of sensors and steering to allow the device to take measurements of soil and rhizosphere properties.
