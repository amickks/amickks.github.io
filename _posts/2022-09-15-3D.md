In Fall 2022, I worked on an independent study with LEMS faculty to develop an affordable tabletop persistence of vision 3D display inspired by their previous work and larger scale models. This project gave me the oppurtunity to assemble a fully-functional Fusion 360 CAD assembly which I was used to plan and design each component and mechnanism. It served as a test to my knowledge of fabrication methods and the tools available to me: the device was constructed mainly from lasercut masonite and 3D-printed PLA, as well as some aluminum sheet metal cut into brackets using the bandsaw.
