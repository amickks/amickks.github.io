Turbulence-generating grid for wind turbine performance testing in a wind tunnel as part of an independent study project with Professor Kenny Breuer. Designed in Fusion360, cut from baltic birch plywood using Shopbot CNC. Secured to wind tunnel using vacuum cups and 3D printed adjustment hooks.

<!--In the fall of 2023, I worked on an independent study project with Professor Kenny Breuer to design a fractal grid to generate turbulence in a wind tunnel. The design was completed in Fusion360, inspired by similar fractal grids in literature. After conducting FEA within the software to determine the stress on the grid under gravity and drag force, I selected baltic birch plywood as the material. The grid was fabricated on a ShopBot CNC. I chose 3" vacuum cups to securely mount the grid to the smooth interior of the wind tunnel. I designed 3D-printed quick-releasing hook attachments for each corner of the grid to streamline installation and removal.-->

<!--The following spring, I worked with lab mates to conduct particle imaging velocimetry to characterize the flow behind the grid. Using this characterization, we plan to run tests on wind turbine performance in the turbulence generated by the grid, in hopes to better understand turbine performance in turbulent conditions.-->
