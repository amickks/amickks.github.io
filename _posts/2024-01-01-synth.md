Collaborating with a friend to design and program a mini synthesizer/sequencer using Teensy 4.2 and Teensy Audio Shield. Work in progress.

<!--In the past few months, I have been working with a friend to build a synthesizer using teensy 4.2 and the teensy audio shield. We have collaborated on all aspects of the design and programming. Currently, the device is able to (1) sample and play back recordings, (2) assign samples and beats to steps on an 8-step sequencer, (3) adjust playback frequency, (4) play sine waves at variable frequency. -->

<!--Moving forward, we are hoping to finalize the board layout and transition to battery power to allow the device to be operated untethered to the computer.-->
