Work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--In the past few months, I have been working with a friend to build a synthesizer using teensy 4.2 and the teensy audio shield. We have collaborated on all aspects of the design and programming. Currently, the device is able to (1) sample and play back recordings, (2) assign samples and beats to steps on an 8-step sequencer, (3) adjust playback frequency, (4) play sine waves at variable frequency. --&gt;

&lt;!--Moving forward, we are hoping to finalize the board layout and transition to battery power to allow the device to be operated untethered to the computer.--&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html">Collaborating with a friend to design and program a mini synthesizer/sequencer using Teensy 4.2 and Teensy Audio Shield.

&lt;!--In the fall of 2023, I worked on an independent study project with Professor Kenny Breuer to design a fractal grid to generate turbulence in a wind tunnel. The design was completed in Fusion360, inspired by similar fractal grids in literature. After conducting FEA within the software to determine the stress on the grid under gravity and drag force, I selected baltic birch plywood as the material. The grid was fabricated on a ShopBot CNC. I chose 3&quot; vacuum cups to securely mount the grid to the smooth interior of the wind tunnel. I designed 3D-printed quick-releasing hook attachments for each corner of the grid to streamline installation and removal.--&gt;

&lt;!--The following spring, I worked with lab mates to conduct particle imaging velocimetry to characterize the flow behind the grid. Using this characterization, we plan to run tests on wind turbine performance in the turbulence generated by the grid, in hopes to better understand turbine performance in turbulent conditions.--&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="fabrication" /><category term="CNC" /><category term="research" /><summary type="html">Turbulence-generating grid for wind turbine performance testing in a wind tunnel as part of an independent study project with Professor Kenny Breuer.

&lt;!--In Fall 2022, I worked on an independent study with LEMS faculty to develop an affordable tabletop persistence of vision 3D display inspired by their previous work and larger scale models. This project gave me the oppurtunity to assemble a fully-functional Fusion 360 CAD assembly which I was used to plan and design each component and mechnanism. It served as a test to my knowledge of fabrication methods and the tools available to me: the device was constructed mainly from lasercut masonite and 3D-printed PLA, as well as some aluminum sheet metal cut into brackets using the bandsaw.--&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="engineering" /><summary type="html">Persistence-of-vision 3D display developed with the Laboratory for Engineering Man-Machine Systems at Brown University.

&lt;!--I began working in Breuer lab in the Summer of 2021. As a part of a research award, I worked with another undergraduate to help assemble and troubleshoot the design of a flapping-wing bat-inspired robot. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--The summer began with working on an older robot which relied on a cam mechanism to reproduce the wing motions of a bat in flight.--&gt;

&lt;!--This involved rewiring many of the cams and adjusting the tension to produce the correct range of motion. Then, I designed a forearm and &quot;hand&quot; so that the robot could be used as a demonstration model. I designed the wing using Fusion 360 and fabricated using 3d-printed resin and laser cut acrylic.--&gt;

&lt;!--The assembly of the new robot began with more fabrication work-- sanding and filing of 3d printed parts, lasercutting acrylic and balsa wood for the wings, developing a method for glueing the kite cloth and struts to the wings, etc.--&gt;

&lt;!--Once assembled, my coworker and I learned to use the Galil motor controller and force transducer DAQ, assembling these into a MATLAB script which we used to measure forces on the wings while flapping on the bench. Eventually, we moved this arrangement to the wind tunnel, where we were able to determine the lift and drag at different wind speeds, flapping frequencies and angles of attack. --&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="fabrication" /><category term="biomimicry" /><category term="research" /><summary type="html">Bat-inspired flapping-wing robot I helped to design, build, and test in Breuer Lab over the course of three years.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/roBat/robat_intunnel.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/roBat/robat_intunnel.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
